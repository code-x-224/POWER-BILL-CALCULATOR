## Introduction

The Power Billing System is designed to assist users in calculating their monthly power bills according to their usage type (Residential, Commercial, or Industrial) and monthly consumption.

## Usage Types

1. **Residential (Code: 1)**
2. **Commercial (Code: 2)**
3. **Industrial (Code: 3)**

## How to Use

1. Run the program.
2. Select your usage type by entering the corresponding code.
3. Enter your monthly consumption in kilowatt-hours (kWh).
4. View your calculated monthly power bill.

## Billing Algorithms

The system uses different billing algorithms based on the type of usage:

- **Residential:**
  - Monthly Power Bill = Monthly Consumption * 12.50 KES/kWh

- **Commercial:**
  - Monthly Power Bill = Monthly Consumption * 15.75 KES/kWh

- **Industrial:**
  - Monthly Power Bill = Monthly Consumption * 18.90 KES/kWh

## Examples

**1. Residential Usage:**
```plaintext
Enter your code: 1
Enter your monthly consumption: 150
Your monthly power bill is: 150 kWh * 12.50 = 1875 KES
```
**2. Commercial Usage:**
```plaintext
Enter your code: 2
Enter your monthly consumption: 200
Your monthly power bill is: 200 kWh * 15.75 = 3150 KES
```
**3. Industrial Usage:**
```plaintext
Enter your code: 3
Enter your monthly consumption: 300
Your monthly power bill is: 300 kWh * 18.90 = 5670 KES
```
